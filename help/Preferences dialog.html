		<h1>The Preferences Dialog
		</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Select <strong>Preferences</strong> (Alt+Enter) from the menu to display the 
			Preferences dialog.

		<p>
			The available options in the dialog are:
		</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>
			<strong>Show Quotes</strong>
		</dt>
			<dd>The Show Quotes options can be used to easier see where strings starts and 
			ends. This is particularily important when the string contains leading and 
			trailing white-space. Since the program normally trims off trailing (but not 
			leading) spaces, the Show Quotes option is the only way to preserve trailing 
			spaces. The quotes are for display purpose only: they are not saved with the 
			string. If you inadverently delete one or both of the quotes this is alright 
			too: the program detects that the quote(s) are missing and adjusts accordingly. 
			</dd>
			<dd>
			<p class="InfoField">You can also enable/disable this option from the main menu (<strong>Ctrl+Q</strong>) 
			without opening the dialog.
		</p></dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt>
			<strong>Invert dictionary</strong>
		</dt>
			<dd>Same as the Invert dicitionary on the main menu. Enabling this option swaps the 
			currently loaded items in the dictionary so you can use the dictionary to 
			translate "the other way" as well. </dd>
			<dd>Note that the inversion stays in effect if you save the dictionary and also 
			when you load another dictionary (i.e if Invert Dictionary<strong>
			</strong>is 
			enabled, the newly loaded dictionary will be inverted as well).
		</dd>
			<dd>You can also enable/disable this option from the main menu (<strong>Ctrl+Alt+I</strong>) 
			without opening the dialog.
		</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Show details</strong> </dt>
			<dd>If enabled, displays a panel beneath the toolbar that shows the Section and Key 
			of the currently selected item.
			</dd>
			<dd>
			<p class="InfoField">You can also enable/disable this option from the main menu (<strong>Ctrl+D</strong>) 
			without opening the dialog.
		</p></dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Show tooltips </strong></dt>
			<dd>Display tooltip windows for toolbar buttons.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt>
			<strong>Show shortcuts in tooltips</strong>
		</dt>
			<dd>Displays the shortcut of the toolbar button in the tooltip. This option can 
			only be changed if <strong>Show tooltips </strong>is enabled.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Ignore &amp;'s in dictionaries </strong></dt>
			<dd>If checked, '&amp;' characters are ignored when comparing dictionary entries to 
			the original string. This enables you to have a dictionary entry like 
			'&amp;Edit' and use it to replace a translation entry like 'Edit'.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Use same start folder for all files </strong></dt>
			<dd>Enable this option if you want the open translation dialog to "chase" the 
			original dialog (and vice versa). This can be hard too understand, but an 
			example might clear it up:
			</dd>
			<dd>
			<p class="InfoField">Let's say you have a couple of files opened in your 
			<u>C:\Program 
				Files\Translations</u> folder. Now you want to open another set of files in 
			the <u>D:\Other\Translations</u> folder instead. Click <strong>Open Original 
				(Ctrl+O) </strong>and browse to the <u>D:\Other\Translations</u> and select 
			a file as usual. <br>
			<br>
			Next, a dialog is shown for the translation file. With the 
			"same folder" option enabled, the start folder for the dialog will be 
			<u>D:\Other\Translations</u>. 
			With the option disabled, the start folder will be <u>C:\Program Files\Translations</u>.
			</p></dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Autofocus translation when typing </strong></dt>
			<dd>When activated, typing in the list will move focus to the translation field 
			where your typing replaces the selected text.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Press RETURN to confirm translation </strong></dt>
			<dd>Normally, a translation is saved as soon as you move to another item. Enable 
			this option to use the RETURN (ENTER) key to confirm the translation without 
			having to move to another item.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Automatically move to next/previous </strong></dt>
			<dd>Enable this option to automatically move to the next item when RETURN is 
			pressed. Press Shift+RETURN to move to the previous item instead. This option 
			can only be changed if <strong>Press RETURN to confirm translation</strong> is 
			enabled.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Remember form position </strong></dt>
			<dd>Enable this option if you want the program to remember the main windows 
			position when you close it.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Remember min/max state </strong></dt>
			<dd>Enable this option if you want the program to remember if the window was 
			minimized/maximized as well. This option can only be changed if 
			<strong>Remember 
				form position</strong> is enabled.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Monitor external file changes </strong></dt>
			<dd>Turns file monitoring on or off. If enabled, external changes to the currently 
			loaded files (original, translation and dictionary) are monitored and you are 
			prompted to reload the file(s) when they have changed. </dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Use translation everywhere </strong></dt>
			<dd>When activated, a newly typed translation will be copied to all other items 
			with an identical original identifier. This is like using the &quot;Use 
			translation everywhere&quot; command without having to press Ctr+Shift+H all 
			the time. </dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Font </strong></dt>
			<dd>Changes the font used by the edits and the listview in the program. Click the 
			button to display a font selection dialog. The font settings are saved and used 
			the next time you start the program. </dd>
			<dd>
			<p class="InfoField">You can also enable/disable this option from the main menu (<strong>Ctrl+Shift+F</strong>) 
			without opening the dialog.
		</p></dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Language </strong></dt>
			<dd>Select or type in the path and filename of the language file yu want to use for 
			the program. Click the browse button (...) to show a dialog that allows you to 
			select a file. Restart the program to use the selected language file. 
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Help </strong></dt>
			<dd>Select the file to be used as the help file for the program. Click the browse 
			button (...) to show a dialog that allows you to select a file. Press 
			<strong>F1 </strong>in the program to display the help file. Note that you can select any type of 
			file as the help file, not only chm or hlp files. When you press F1, the file 
			will be opened with the program associated with the selected file type.
