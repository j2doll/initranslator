<h1>Opening and Saving Files</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The ini-style language format requires that you open two files: one file (the
      "original") is displayed in the left list column and the other (the
      "translation") is displayed in the right list column in the top part of the
      program.
    </p>
    <p>To open both the original and translation file at the same time, select <strong>Open
        Original</strong> (Ctrl+O) from the menu: you will be presented with two
      dialogs that allows you to first select the original file and then the
      translation file. If you only want to load the original file, click the <strong>Cancel
      </strong>button when the second dialog appears. If you already have the
      original file loaded and want to load another translation file, select <strong>Open
        Translation</strong> (Ctrl+Shift+O) instead.
    </p>
    <p>The program matches the items in the translation to the items in the original
      by comparing their Section and Name (Sections are unique and so are Names
      within a Section. The comparision is not case-sensitive). Items not found in
      the original file is not displayed in the list.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p> Conversely, items from the
      original not found in the translation file, will show as empty items in the
      translation column. These items also have a light gray background color to
      quickly find them.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p> When you save the translation, these new items are saved as
      well. If you load a translation without first loading an original, the list
      will be empty. The program automatically opens the last opened files the next time you start it.
