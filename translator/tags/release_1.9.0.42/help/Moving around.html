    <h1> Moving Around</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The program has some simplifications to avoid the use of 
the mouse as much as possible. While you are typing in the
      Translation field, you can move around in the list simply by pressing <b> Ctrl+Up</b> (Arrow), <b>
      Ctrl+Down</b> (Arrow), <b>Ctrl+PageUp</b>, <b>Ctrl+PageDown</b>, <b> Ctrl+Home</b>&nbsp;and <b> Ctrl+End</b>&nbsp;on the keyboard. The program will move to
      another item without leaving the translation field. The currently edited item will be
      saved automatically.</p>
    <p>All commands (except the list column sorting) are available from the menu
      and most menu items have associated shortcut keys.&nbsp;To activate the menu with
      the keyboard, press F10 and then use the arrow keys to move around. Press 
	<b>ENTER</b>
      on the menu item you want to execute. To return focus to the program, press
      <b>ESCAPE</b> one or&nbsp;more times.
    </p>
    <p>Select <strong>Next untranslated</strong> (Ctrl+U) and <strong>Previous
        untranslated</strong> (Ctrl+Shift+U) from the menu to quickly jump to the
      next or previous empty translation. You can sort the items in the list by
      clicking on one of the columns. This way the empty items are placed at the top
      or bottom of the list (depending on sort direction) and you can quickly
      estimate the number of items to translate and also quickly translate items since
      you don't have to look for them.</p>
