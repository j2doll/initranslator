    <h1> Editing Items</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>You can only directly edit the items displayed in the right column. To edit an item,
      select it in the list and type the translation into the <strong>Translation</strong>
      field at the bottom of the program. When you move to another item (use Ctrl+Up
      and Ctrl+Down to move between items in the list without having to use the mouse), the
      modified text is automatically updated in the list. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you are satisfied with
      your editing, save the translation by selecting <strong>Save Translation</strong>
      (Ctrl+S) <strong>&nbsp;</strong>from the menu. If you want to save the
      translation with another name, select <strong>Save Translation As</strong> instead and select a new name for the file.</p>
