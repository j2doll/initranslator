<h3>The ini file format</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The file format natively supported by this program follows the original ini file 
format used in Windows. An ini file is a text file with rows of items where each group of items are delimited by a <em>Section</em>. Each Section can contain any number of <em>Name=</em><em>Value</em> pairs.&nbsp;Each section must be unique within the file.&nbsp;A section is enclosed in square brackets (i.e. [Section]) and the left square bracket must be the first character on the line. The Section can contain spaces. All characters following the right square bracket are ignored.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Name=Value pair must appears on a single line and the start of the Name must be the first character on the row.&nbsp;A Name can contain any character except the equal sign as it is used as the delimiter before the Value.&nbsp;A Value can contain any characters, including equal signs.&nbsp;Within a Section, a Name must be unique, but a Value doesn't have to be.&nbsp;Sections, Names and Values are handled in a case-insensitive manner.&nbsp;Values may not contain line-break characters.&nbsp;A line starting with a semi-colon is handled as a comment and ignored.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>;This is a comment
[Section]
Name1=Value1
Name2=Value2
</pre>

<p class="InfoField"><strong>NOTE:</strong> the latest version of the program (1.3 
and later) can also handle files without any Sections - all items will then be part of an empty Section and a section will <i>not</i> be written to the file when saving. In addition, version 1.3 
(and later) preserves comments at their original location.</p>
