    <h1>Dictionaries</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>As you begin to translate programs you soon find that a lot of the texts used
      in software are identical (labels like OK, Cancel, Apply, File, Edit etc are
      used in just about every program in the world). To avoid having to translate
      these items manually time after time, the program has support for dictionaries.
      A dictionary is simply a file containing pairs of text strings for a specific
      language combination. F ex, one file might contain english and polish string
      pairs, another file might contain german and french string pairs.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The following functions are available for dictionaries:</p>
    <ul>
		<li>To add an item in the list to the currently loaded dictionary, select the
		<b>Add to 
    Dictionary</b> command. </li>
		<li>To edit the items in the currently loaded dictionary manually, select
		<b>Edit Dictionary</b>. 
	A dialog is displayed that allows you to add, edit and remove both original 
	strings and translations.</li>
		<li>To use a specific dictionary, select <strong>Load Dictionary</strong> from the
      menu and select a dictionary file in the dialog. The name of the currently
      loaded dictionary is displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the program.
      After loading a dictionary, you can use it to translate all empty items in the
      list by selecting <strong>Translate using Dictionary</strong> from the menu.
      A dialog is displayed that guides you through the translation process.
    	</li>
		<li>To create a new or update an existing dictionary, select the <strong>New
        Dictionary</strong> command from the menu. You will be asked whether you want to
      create a new dictionary or add new items to the currently loaded dictionary. 
		</li>
		<li>To invert a dictionary, select the <strong>Invert Dictionary</strong> 
		command
      from the menu. This swaps the currently loaded items in the dictionary so you
      can use the dictionary to translate "the other way" as well. <b>Note</b> that the
      inversion stays in effect if you save the dictionary and also when you load
      another dictionary (i.e if <strong>Invert Dictionary </strong>is enabled, the
      newly loaded dictionary will be inverted as well).&nbsp; </li>
	</ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If you have made changes to the dictionary, you will be prompted to save 
    it when you close the program or select another dictionary.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="InfoField">
	<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
	<p>Even if you change the in-memory dictionary, the dictionary on disk will not be altered until you select <strong>Save
        Dictionary</strong> from the menu. To view the disk file content of the
      currently selected dictionary, select <strong>View Dictionary</strong> from the
      <b>Tools </b>menu. This opens the dictionary file in Notepad and display it.
