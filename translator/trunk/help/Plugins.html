<h1>Plugins</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>There are two kinds of plugins supported by IniTranslator: file parsers and 
tool items. A file parser reads and writes files in formats not natively 
supported by IniTranslator. This allows you to work with any type of file that 
can represent its text content as original/translation string pairs without 
having to leave IniTransaltor. There are several file parsers supplied in the 
default installation of IniTranslator. </p>
<p>A tool plugin work swith the items already loaded into IniTranslator. These 
plugins appear on a special Plugins menu whenever they are available. These 
types of plugins are used to perfomr common tasks, like trimming text or 
supplying an alternative method of editing the items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Writing plugins</h4>
<p>Developers can write their own plugins if they have access to a development 
tool that fulfills these requirements :</p>
<ol>
	<li>it must understand interfaces </li>
	<li>it must be able to create pure 32-bit Windows DLL files</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following discussion assumes Delphi syntax, but you can use any tool that 
supports the requirements above. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="InfoField"><b>Note</b> <br>
<br>
When a function or method returns a <b>HResult</b>, you should generally return
<b>S_OK</b> if the method executed normally, <b>S_FALSE</b> otherwise. If any 
other return value is expected, it is described in the documentation.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Writing a file parser</h4>
<p>A file parser imports and exports file data to/from IniTranslator. It doesn't 
matter to IniTranslator in what format the data is stored as long as it can be 
translated to the concept of a Original-Translation pair. A file parser must 
implement the IFileParser interface:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><b>type</b>
  IFileParser = <b>interface</b>(IInterface)
  <font color="#000080">['{3E556846-9B4D-4722-B48F-48D020715509}']</font>
<i><font color="#000080">    </font></i><b>function</b> ExportItems(<b>const</b> Items, Orphans: ITranslationItems): HResult; <b>safecall</b>;
    <b>function</b> ImportItems(<b>const</b> Items, Orphans: ITranslationItems): HResult; <b>safecall</b>;
    <b>function</b> DisplayName(Capability: integer): WideString; <b>safecall</b>; 
    <b>function</b> Capabilities: integer; <b>safecall</b>; 
    <b>function</b> Configure(Capability: integer): HResult; <b>safecall</b>;
    <b>procedure</b> Init(<b>const</b> ApplicationServices: IApplicationServices); <b>safecall</b>;
  <b>end</b>;</pre>
<p><b>ExportItems </b>is called whenever the user has chosen to export the items 
in IniTranslator using this file parser. You should provide a preview dialog 
where the user can see the effect of his changes, provide additional options if 
necessary and save the file if the user so chooses. A generic Delphi export form 
is provided in the source sohould you need one or you could build your own.</p>
<p><b>ImportItems </b>is called whenever the user chooses to import a file using 
this parser. You should provide a dialog where the user can select the file(s) 
to import and provide any additional options required to succesfully improt a 
file.</p>
<p><b>DisplayName </b>is called whenever IniTranslator needs to display info 
about the plugin in the UI. Capability is either CAP_IMPORT or CAP_EXPORT 
indicating which string is required.</p>
<p><b>Capabilities </b>is called by Initransaltor to determine if the file 
parser supports importing, exporting or bith. Additionally, if your plugin 
provide some type of configuration dialog you can return this capability as well. 
The return value of Capabilities is a combination of the values CAP_IMPORT, 
CAP_EXPORT and CAP_CONFIGURE</p>
<p><b>Configure </b>is called either when the user clicks the Configure button 
in the UI or when he elects to import/export using this parser. Capability 
indicates whether this request originated in the import (CAP_IMPORT) or export (CAP_EXPORT) 
dialog.</p>
<p><b>Init</b> is called before any other methods of the plugin. You should 
store an internal reference to the IApplicationServices interface if you plan to 
use any of its services later on (like calling the Translate method). If you are 
planning on displaying dialogs of your own (most file parses do), you should at 
least store the DLL's current ApplicationHandle, change it to use 
IApplicationServices.AppHandle and, when the DLL is unloaded, restore the 
original ApplicationHandle. This ensures that any dialogs that your plugin 
displays, will behave correctly with IniTranslator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Writing a tool plugin</h4>
<p>A tool plugin works on the items loaded into IniTranslator. Typical usage is 
performing a specific action on one or more items in the list, providing an 
alternative editing experience or viewing the data in another format. The IToolItem 
interface definition look like this:</p>
<pre><b>type</b>
  IToolItem = <b>interface</b>(IInterface)
  <font color="#000080">['{E14F5620-0EC9-43B5-816C-1A265C3FF237}']
</font>    <b>function </b>DisplayName: WideString; <b>safecall</b>;
    <b>function </b>About: WideString; <b>safecall</b>;
    <b>function </b>Status(<b>const </b>Items, Orphans: ITranslationItems; <b>const </b>SelectedItem: ITranslationItem): Integer; <b>safecall</b>;
    <b>function </b>Icon: LongWord; <b>safecall</b>;
    <b>function </b>Execute(<b>const </b>Items, Orphans: ITranslationItems; <b>var </b>SelectedItem: ITranslationItem): HResult; <b>safecall</b>;
    <b>procedure </b>Init(<b>const </b>ApplicationServices: IApplicationServices); <b>safecall</b>;
  <b>end</b>;
</pre>
<p><b>DisplayName </b>should return the text to show in the UI (on a menu item 
or similar)</p>
<p><b>About </b>should return a string that in more detail describes the plugin, 
information about the creator etc (currently not used)</p>
<p><b>Status</b> should return the current status of the plugin. Use the passed 
in parameters to help you determine whether to enable or disable the plugin. The 
valid values you can return is a bit-wise combination of the constants <b>
TOOL_VISIBLE, TOOL_ENABLED, TOOL_CHECKED</b>. You should treat the parameters as 
read-only in this method, i.e donät try to add, edit or delete items in the 
lists.</p>
<p><b>Icon</b> should return a handle to an icon (not currently used). Return 0 
if there is no icon</p>
<p><b>Execute</b> is called when the user activates the plugin (currently by 
clicking the menu item). This is where the plugin does its work. You can add, 
delete and modify the items in the Items and Orphans list and you can change the 
value of the SelectedItem if you like. The UI is frozen until you return from 
this method.</p>
<p><b>Init</b> is called before any other methods of the plugin. You should 
store an internal reference to the IApplicationServices interface if you plan to 
use any of its services later on (like calling the Translate method). If you are 
planning on displaying dialogs of your own (most file parses do), you should at 
least store the DLL's current ApplicationHandle, change it to use IApplicationServices.AppHandle and, when the DLL is unloaded, restore the 
original ApplicationHandle. This ensures that any dialogs that your plugin 
displays, will behave correctly with IniTranslator.</p>
<h4>Registering a plugin</h4>
<p>Every plugin must export one or more functions from the DLL that tells 
IniTranslator that a plugin available from the DLL. Due to the internal structure of IniTranslator, a DLL can only contain one single file parser, but you can have 
as meny tool plugins as you like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To register a file parser, export a function named <font color="#000080"><i>
&quot;RegisterTransFileParser001&quot;</i> </font>with the following signature:</p>
<pre><b>function </b>(<b>out </b>Parser: IFileParser): HResult; <b>stdcall</b>;</pre>
<pre>When this function is called, you should create an instance of a class that implements IFileParser and return it in the Parser variable.
</pre>
<p>To register your tool plugins, export a function named <i>
<font color="#000080">&quot;RegisterTransToolItems001&quot;</font></i> with the following 
signature:</p>
<pre><b>function </b>(<b>out </b>ToolItems: IToolItems): HResult; <b>stdcall</b>;
</pre>
<p>Note that this function actually returns an interface that can hold a list of 
IToolItem and thus you can register more than one tool plugin per DLL. When this 
function is called, you should create an instance of a class that implements 
IToolItems and return it in the ToolItems variable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Supporting localization</h4>
<p>Not only is IniTranslator a translation tool, but it also supports having its 
own UI translated. IniTranslator uses text files in ini file format with the 
extension .lng for its own language files. These files can be edited with 
IniTranslator itself. You can 
use the IniTranslator translation mechanism in your plugins by performing two 
simple steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
	<li>Implement the ILocalizable interface in each of your file parsers and/or 
	tool plugins</li>
	<li>Call IApplicationServices.Translate whenever you need to display a text 
	in your plugins UI </li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ILocalizable interface looks like this:</p>
<pre><b>type</b>
  ILocalizable = <b>interface</b>(IInterface)
  <font color="#000080">['{E10D0143-B334-4CCE-898A-F25384D79C6E}']
</font>    <b>function </b>GetString(<b>out </b>Section:WideString; <b>out </b>Name:WideString; <b>out </b>Value:WideString):WordBool;<b> stdcall</b>;
  <b>end</b>;</pre>
<p>This is a very simple interface with only one method and the only thing you 
need to do is to supply a new Name/Value pair every time the method is called. 
You should also supply at least one Section name that is unique to you, your 
company or your plugin (you can use several Section names if you like). Return 
true as long as Section, Name and Value contains valid values. Do not include 
carriage returns or line feeds in the strings. Instead, encode these as &quot;\r\n&quot; 
or use another scheme you prefer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This method is only called when the user creates a new 
translation template for IniTranslator. This is not something users do 
regularily. In fact, most users never do it, opting to use default.lng or 
another language file in the languages folder of their installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access the translated strings at runtime (they might not be translated; 
this depends on whether the user has a UI language file loaded or not), use the <b>
IApplicationServices.Translate(Section, Name, Value)</b> method, passing in the 
same Section and Name as you returned from <b>ILocalizable.GetString</b>. As for Value, use the default value for the string. If the user has a .lng 
file loaded and a translation for your string was found, the translation is 
returned. If no string was found, the default Value is returned instead.<br>
