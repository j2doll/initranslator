		<h1>Spell checking&nbsp;
		</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Spell checking in IniTranslator is handled by the excellent Delphi spell checker 
			component from Addictive Software (<a href="http://www.addictivesoftware.com">http://www.addictivesoftware.com</a>). 
			To spell check a translation file (only translation files are spell checked 
			since the original file is read-only in IniTranslator), select the "<strong>Action-Spelling</strong>" 
			menu item (or press F7). The spell check dialog wil be displayed, already 
			containing the first word of the currently selected translation item:</p>

		<P>

		</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>The dialog contains the following commands:</P>
		<DL>
            <dt>Ignore</dt>
            <dd>
            Skip this word and go to the next word. If the current item doesn't contain 
			any more items, the selection is moved to the next item in the list</dd>
			<dt>Ignore All</dt>
			<dd>Same as Ignore but does not ask about this word again</dd>
			<dt>Change
			<dd>Change the word in <STRONG>"Not found"</STRONG> to 
				the word in <STRONG>"Replace With"</STRONG>. You can double-click an item in 
				the <STRONG>"Suggestions"</STRONG> list to use as the replacement word or type 
				in a word directly in <STRONG>"Replace With"</STRONG></dd>
			<dt>Change All</dt>
			<dd>Same as Change but the next time the same misspelled word is encountered, it 
			is automatically translated without prompting</dd>
			<dt>Add</dt>
			<dd>Adds the word in "Not found" to the personal dictionary</dd>
			<dt>Cancel</dt>
			<dd>Closes the spell checking dialog</dd>
			<dt>Options</dt>
			<dd>Displays the options dialog:</dd><BR>
		</dl>
		<P><img src="images/SpellCheckOptions.jpg" border="0" /></P>
		<P>
			&nbsp;</P>
		<P>The options dialog contains&nbsp;settings to control how spell checking is 
			performed and what dictionaries should be used. Click the <STRONG>"Dictionaries"</STRONG>
			button&nbsp;to view and edit your custom dictionaries. Click <STRONG>"Reset 
				Defaults"</STRONG> to reset all settings to the defaults as they were at 
			first startup. Option settings are stored on a per-user basis.
			<br>

			<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Note:</span><br>
			To be able to spell check, you will need to install at least one dictionary for 
			the language of the translation file you are working on. You can get free 
			dictionaries from the Addict homepage at <a href="http://www.addictivesoftware.com/dicts.htm">
				http://www.addictivesoftware.com/dicts.htm</a>.
			<br>
			<br>
			Save the dictionaries in the <EM>\dictionaries</EM> subfolder of the 
			IniTranslator install folder to make them available&nbsp;in the spell checker.<br>
